This is a small App that tries to work on the following aspects:

- Basic usage of Monads such as Either, using [arrow-kt][2]
- a testable Kotlin architecture where all requirements can be covered with Unit Tests
- Kotlin Code style & formatting check using [ktlint][3]
- Android UI Design using [ConstraintLayout][5]
