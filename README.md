This is a small App that tries to work on the following aspects:

- Dependency Injection in Kotlin using [Kodein 5.x][1]
- Basic usage of Monads such as Either, using [arrow][2]
- a testable Kotlin architecture where all requirements can be covered with Unit Tests
- Kotlin Code style & formatting check using [ktlint][3]
